      Vangibath is a common dish in South India - especially in Karnataka. It is made of eggplants, a bunch of spices and rice. If you are in a mood for another rice based dish, you are in for a treat. The spices/masala adds wonderful texture and taste to this dish, and you definitely want to serve some sort of Yogurt based dish (Raita) along with this.
  
      The name "Vangi" means egg plant, and "Vangibath" means an eggplant mixed in with rice. There are other famous rice based dishes in Karnataka, like **Bisi Belebath**, which we will cover in the future.

      Now that you have the Vangibath Masala powder, let's bring all the ingredients together to make the final dish. It is recommended you take a large pan as you are going to be adding all the ingredients including cooked Basmati Rice. The bigger the pan you have, the better and easier to mix the contents.

        2. Cover with lid and let them cook on medium low frame till eggplant pieces are nice and tender.
        3. Once contents cooked well, turn the frame to low and add **Vangibath Masala** powder. Mix well and cook for few more minutes without closing lid.

    preparation_details: |-
      1. Cook Basmati Rice in advance and spread the rice in a large bowl, let it dry.
      2. You also need to make Vangibath masala. Either you can get readymade masala powder from the store, or make your own. I'll show you how to make your own masala.
      3. Cut the egg plants into small pieces and keep them aside
      4. Take a small cube of Tamarind, remove the seeds, and make it into a puree by blending it in a mixture by adding a little bit of water. 
      5. Chop the Cilantro into small pieces - don't chop the Cilantro into extremely small pieces - you want to be able to feel the cilantro in the dish!
    other_details: |-
      The Tamarind Puree adds a bit of tanginess, and if you prefre not to have that extremely slight tanginess or sourness, you can skip adding Tamarind puree.
      Make sure you serve Vangibath hot, and also serve the yogurt based side-dish, Raita!
