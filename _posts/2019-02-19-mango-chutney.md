  title: "Mukkala Pachhadi"
  excerpt: "Mukkala Pachhadi is made mainly from raw mangoes, it can be eaten with hot rice, rotis, idls, and dosas."
  description: "This South Indian dish can be very spicy at times, if you love spicy things, then this is your kind of meal! It can last up to a month in 
  a sealed conatiner thats being put in a refigerator. This chutney mixes well with rice because this chutney is eaten well when its cold, and that contrasts 
  with the hot rice. This dish also promotes a healthy gut and helps with disgestion."
