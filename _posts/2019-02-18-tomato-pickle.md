    directions_markdown: |-
      1. Turn the stove on and pre-heat a big pan, and pour 4 to 5 table spoons of oil 
      2. Once the oil is medium hot, pour all tomato puree in that pan very carefully. Be very careful with the hot oil!
      3. Add Turmeric, Salt, Jaggery and Tamarind, and cook about 30 minutes in medium frame. 
      4. Do not put a lid/cover on the pan. You want ALL the moisture/water from the tomatoes to completely evaporate! This is a critical step, as the longevty depends on how much moisture is left in the puree!
      5. Keep mixing the contents every few minutes - you want all the puree to cook evenly - not just the bottom part.
      6. Keep mixing the contents for aout 20 minutes or so! **DO NOT** cut corners here! You want all the moisture to evaporate and puree to be a thick paste!
      7. After 20 to 25 minutes, you will start to notice the paste becomes much thicker, and that's when you want to turn the stove off. 
      8. Let it cool down for a few minutes. Transfer the contents to another dish.
      9. Take another frying pan and fry fenugreek seeds in low frame **without oil** until the seess turn into brown color. 
      10. Once the seeds are in golden brown color, turn off the stove, let it cool and after that, blend it into a fine powder.
      11. Now add Fenugreek Seeds powder and Dried Red Chilli Powder to the the Tomato paste that you made earlier
      12. Time to add seasoning - take another small pan, pour some oil and turn on heat, and once the oil is hot enough, add Mustard Seeds, Cumim Seeds, Curry Leaves, Urad Dal, Red Chillies pieces, Asafoetida.
      13. Turn the stove off add curry leaves. Pour all tempering on the tomato pickle.
      14. Mix thoroughly, and keep it aside.
      15. After a few minutes, transfer the entire content into an air-tight container.
      16. The pickle is ready to eat!
