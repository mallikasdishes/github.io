      1. Wash Basmati rice at least two or three times in running water, and soak the rice in cold water for 10 minutes. Later, drain water and leave the rice in the bowl and set it aside
      2. Heat vegetable oil in a non-stick saucepan for about 2 minutes or so on medium heat
      3. When the oil is hot enough (you can see the sizzling), add all the spices mentioned below in the hot oil in the following order and keep mixing while you add the ingredients. The order is critical because some ingredients don't need too much of heat, some need heat to get the juices flowing. Cinnamon, Cloves, Cardamom, Bay Leaves, Star Anise, Cashews
      4. Add onion slices into the mixture and roast until the onion slices turns into a golden brown tint
      5. Add mint leaves
      6. Add Ginger Garlic Paste and fry for about 5 minutes or so until toasted and fragrant, and then add coriander powder, cumin powder, red chili powder, and a little bit of salt
      7. Continue to fry for about 2 more minutes
      8. Add all the rest of the vegetables and mix thoroughly
      9. Close the lid tightly and let it cook for about 5 minutes until the vegetables cook nice and soft - especially the potatoes and carrots.
      10. The Biryani mixture is ready when all the vegetables are cooked nice and even
      11. Turn the stove off and keep it aside. Now it is time to make Basmati rice.

Final Step:
In a rice cooker, add soaked Biryani rice, 7 ½ cups of water (as a general guide, for each cup of rice, use 1 ½ cup of water to cook evenly), Biryani mixture, remaining salt and leave the cooker ON for about 30 minutes. Mix the contents in the cooker ONCE after 15 minutes or so for nice even cooking.

The Biryani is now ready. Serve it with a side dish - either Potato Masala Curry or Raita.
