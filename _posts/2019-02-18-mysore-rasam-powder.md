      1. Take Coreander Seeds, Black Pepper Seeds, Red Chillies, Fenugreek seeds and Cumin Seeds in a non-stick pan, and fry for a little while – for a few minutes until the aroma comes out.
      2. Make sure you do not roast them - Once you start seeing the red chillies turning into black color, turn the stove off immediately and transfer the contents to a different pan.
      3. Also, it is advised not to use any oil in the pan while frying. We need to keep this as dry as possible. Adding oil while frying the spices will dampen the contents and adds unwanted moisture. 
      4. Add dry grated coconut in the end as you don’t want to roast the grated coconut.
      5. Once frying is complete, let it cool for a few minutes. Do not keep it in the refrigerator to speed up the cooling process – it will add unwanted moisture. It has to cool down naturally.
      6. Once it cools down to the room temperature, grind them to powder and store it in a vacuum sealed or air-tight container.
