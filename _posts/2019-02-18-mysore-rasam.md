      Mysore Rasam is a South Indian dish, basically a spicy soup that is made of various spices and lentil/peas. The name Mysore Rasam was given to this dish possibly because it was originated from Mysore, a prominent place in South India. If you are a spice lover, this is a must try dish, and is typically served with Rice, and also served with other breakfast items like Idli, Dosa, Pongal…more!
  
      To make this dish, first you have to make the Spicy Rasam mixture – we should be calling it Mysore Rasam Mixture as this is different from a typical “Rasam” powder/mixture. Once you make the Mysore Rasam mixture, you can store it in an air tight container, and can last anywhere between 3 to 6 months when stored in a non-humid environment. Once you have the mixture, it is extremely easy to make the Soup, just follow the steps and you will be done in no time.
      
      Even though this was not a common dish when and where I grew up, it was passed on to me by my family. Once I tasted this, I could not stop making it every now and then. This is one of my and my family's favorite "Rasam" of all time! This soup also works at its best when have cold and you want something hot and spicy to clear your throat, sinus, and take your taste buds for a ride.
