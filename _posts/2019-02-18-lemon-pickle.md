  title: Lemon Pickle
  excerpt: |-
    Pickles are very common in India, and among the pickles, a lemon pickle is unique because of the sourness combined with spiciness. If you are into that sort of thing, you are in for a treat!
  description: |-
    **Lemon Pickle** is one of the most commonly used pickles in the South Indian household. It is relatively inexpensive to make it, and will last very long time as long it is handled with care.

    The pickle can be eaten raw, with rice dishes or even with Rotic/Chapathis. You can make it super hot/spicy or less spicy. It is not a quick dish to make, as with many pickles, it is a multi-day effort. 

    One thing to note that Chutneys are different from Pickles. Chutneys don't last very long, and are meant to be eaten fresh and if you refrigerate them, you may be able to eat them for a few days. Whereas the pickles last for a very long time. In fact, for some pickles, the longer they are stored, the better they taste. 

    This recipe is a pickle recipe, and once it is refrigerated, it should last for 6 to 12 months, and lemon pickle tastes WAY better when it gets old.

      1. Hopefully you've followed the preparation details. After waiting for a couple days...
      2. On the third day, thoroughly mix it using a dry spoon.
      3. Heat the pan and gently fry Fenugreek seeds till they are brown in color.
      4. Let the Methi seeds (Fenugreek) cool down naturally, and then crush them into a fine powder.
      5. Now add Fenugreek powder, red chilli powder into the lemon mixture, and thoroughly mix them together. You will see the juices flowing. 
      6. It is time to add Seasoning. If you are not familiar with the Seasoning, read information under additional comments section below.
      7. Mix both Seasoning and prepared lemon mixture well and store in a dry container.
      8. You can start eating after a couple of days. If you wait longer, the lemon pieces will be soft and will not have that sour taste.
      9. Keep it in the refrigerator for longer life.

      1. The trick to keep the lemon pickle to last longer is to keep the moisture away or direct contact with moisture away. **DO NOT** use wet spoons, unclean spoons and leave the lid open in a moist environment.
      2. Always keep the pickle in an air tight container, and use clean utensils when serving.
      3. It is always best not to touch the pickle directly with your fingers inside the jar.
      4. Definitely, no licking and double dipping your fingers!

      Seasoning - Take a frying pan, Heat 2 cups of vegetable oil and add 1 1/2 spoons of mustard seeds, 10 or 12 dried red chillies and 1/2 spoon Hing. Let the mustard seeds splutter and remove the flame and let it cool.
