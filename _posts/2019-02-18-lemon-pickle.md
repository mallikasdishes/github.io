  title: Lemon Pickle
  excerpt: |-
    Pickles are very common in India, and among the pickles, a lemon pickle is unique because of the sourness combined with spiciness. If you are into that sort of thing, you are in for a treat!
  description: |-
    Lemon Pickle is one of the most commonly used pickles in the household. It is relatively inexpensive to make it, and will last very long time as long it is handled with care.

    The pickle can be eaten raw, with rice dishes or even with Rotic/Chapathis. You can make it super hot/spicy or less spicy. It is not a quick dish to make, as with many pickles, it is a multi-day effort. One thing to note that Chutneys are different from Pickles. Chutneys don't last very long, and are meant to be eaten fresh and if you refrigerate them, you will be able to eat them for few days. Whereas the pickles last for a very long time. In fact, for some pickles, the longer they are stored, the better they taste. This recipe is a pickle, and if refrigerate it, it will last for 6 to 12 months, and lemon pickle tastes WAY better when it gets old.
