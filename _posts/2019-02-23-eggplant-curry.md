      1. In a heated pan, add peanuts, Channa Dal, Urad Dal and roast them on medium low heat.
      2. Once those ingredients turned to golden brown in color, reduce the stove to low, and add Fenugreek Seeds, Coriander Seeds, Cumin Seeds, Dried Red Chillies, and Coconut Powder.
      3. Continue to stir and fry these ingredients. Make sure you do not roast them! Once they are fried properly, turn off the stove and keep them aside.
      4. Take another pan, add oil, Turmeric Powder and fry untill you see the onions are fried properly.
      5. Turn off the stove, and let all the spices cool down for a few minutes.
      6. Put all of the spices, Onions, Salt, Jaggery, Tamarind Puree, Turmeric and Water (Do not add too much) into a mixer jar. 
      7. Blend the contents until they become **thick paste**. This curry masala should be a thick paste and not watery as you will be taking spoonful and put it inside the eggplants. 
      8. Slice all eggplants in a cross-hair pattern on the bottom (do not cut all the wayand keep stems) - you just need a little bit of opening, so that you can put in the masala.
      9. Now stuff the prepared thick masala paste to all the eggplants and keep it aside.
      10. In a large pan, heat 5 tbsb oil and add the stuffed eggplants in that pan, spinkle 1/4 water and close the lid. The flame should be at medium heat. Do not put too much water, you need just enough water to cook eggplants, and not make it like a soup.
      11. Let it cook for about 5 to 7 minutes then gently mix the contents. Don't be too aggressive in mixing, as you may break the cooked eggplants. You want to keep them as-is but cooked with yummy masala inside.
      12. When you start seeing oil floating to the top, that's when you know it is cooked completely.
      13. Turn off the stove, garnish with finely chopped Cilantro and enjoy with rice and rotis.
