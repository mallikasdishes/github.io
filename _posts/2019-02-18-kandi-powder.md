      Kandi Podi, also known as Kandi Powder, a very famous spice in South India. It is typically eaten with Rice and if you are creative, you can find many ways to eat this with. It is basically a spicy powder, made of different kinds of lentils and spices, and full of protein. The spice level can be adjusted according to your needs. I personally like to make two versions of the same with different spice levels - one for kids and one for adults, who can tolerate more spiciness.
      
      Once you make the Kandi Podi, it can last anywhere between 3 to 6 months as long as it is stored in an air tight container and not exposed to the humidity. It comes as an emergency food item - when you don't have time to cook curries and/or other dishes, just whip out some rice and mix with Kandi Powder, and you are good to go! Add a bit of an Oil or Ghee and it tastes even yummier! :o)

      If you are wondering, the name **Kandi Podi** originated from Telugu language, where *Podi* means *Powder*, and *Kandi Pappu* means Toor Dal. Basically *Kandi Podi* translates into *Toor Dal Powder*. Just a simple name given to a dish that is extremely popular in Andhra Pradesh. I hope you try it out!
