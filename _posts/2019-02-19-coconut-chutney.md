    There is little bit of tradition and history to this chutney. According to the Hindu religion, Coconut is considered one of the purest form of fruit one can offer to God. Many families buy coconuts along with vegetables from markets, and offer coconuts to God as part of their regular prayres at home. After the prayer, they break the coconut, drink the water, and use the inner core in chutneys 😊
