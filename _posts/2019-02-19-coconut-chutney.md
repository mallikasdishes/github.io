  title: "Kobbari Chutney"
  excerpt: "Kobbari chutney is a coconut based chutney that is mainly eaten in southern India."
  description: "This is a coconut chutney that is mainly eaten as a side to dosa and idli, as well as rice and rotis. It is not a spicy dish but it 
  is loaded with flavor. When eaten with hot rice and ghee, it feels like you're in heaven. It need to be stored in a moisture free environment, 
  and in an air tight container to maintain the freshness of the chutney."
