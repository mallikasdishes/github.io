      1. Take a pan, add Coriander Seeds, Chana Dal, Black Gram, Cumin Seeds, Dried Red Chillis and fry for a few minutes until you see the Chana Dal and other items turning into golden/brownish color. Transfer the content into a bowl.
      2. Add Curry Leaves to the same pan and mix very lightly until the leaves become crispy and crunchy. Transfer this into the same bowl where we transferred Coriander Seeds and other items.
      3. Add Seedless Tamarind to the same pan and mix very lightly and transfer this into a different bowl, keeping it separate from the previous content, and leave all the content to be cooled by keeping it aside.
      4. Add all the content except Tamarind into a blender, add Salt and Hing and blend them together until they become coarse powder.
      5. Add Tamarind and blend once again until it mixes evenly.
      6. Make sure you store it in an air-tight container. Karivepaku Powder is ready for use.
