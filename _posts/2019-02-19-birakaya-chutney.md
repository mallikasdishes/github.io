  directions_markdown: |-
      1. Take a pan and add some vegetable/peanut oil, fry all ingredients, then keep it aside.
      2. Cut the Ridge Gourd vegetable into small pieces (with skin). The skin has a lot of fiber, and no need to peel the vegetable.
      3. Take some oil and put the cut vegetable, salt, turmeric, and little bit of Jaggery, close the lid and cook 7 to 10 minutes in medium frame.
      4. After about 10 minutes, turn off the stove and let it cool down for a few minutes.
      5. Now put all the contents in a blender, and make it into a coarse grain paste.
      6. Do not make it into a paste, as you want to keep the texture and feel the fibers while you eat.
