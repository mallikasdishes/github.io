      Sambhar Powder is a primary ingredient in making an extremely famous South Indian dish - called "Sambhar". Sambhar is a Soup that  is high in protein, and is full of cooked vegetables, and usually goes with just about anything. If you ask anyone from southern part of India, they will agree that Sambhar virtually goes with anything and everything. It is a must have dish for weddings, festivals, potlucks, get togethers, and more! As usual, there are many ways to make this one. The recipe below happen to be the one that we use at home. It is based on traditional South Indian Sambhar.
      The Sambhar Powder is relatively easy to make, and once it is made, it can be stored for long time. Of course it need to be kept in a moisture free environment, and in an air tight container to maintain the freshness of the spices. For the Sambhar to taste best, it is highly recommended to make this powder just before making the Sambhar. Lets go through the recipe on how to make this powder first, and in later posts, I will talk about how to make Sambhar.
