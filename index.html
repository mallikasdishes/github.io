<p><strong>Greetings</strong> and Welcome to Mallika's Dishes website!</p>

<p>Thank you for being here. Here you will find nothing but <strong>The Best and Authentic Vegetarian South Indian Dishes</strong>. This is my personal 
collection of recipes that I use <u>every day</u> at home, that I have collected over the years. I am a strict vegetarian, and you will ONLY find vegetarian recipes in here. </p>

<p>I know there are many websites and blogs out there with similar recipes, my goal is to digitize what I have in a small notebook, and make it accessible to me (no matter where I am), my family and friends.
Many of my family and friends ask me for recipes, and this website makes it easy for me to share and exchange new cooking ideas.</p>

<p>As they say, Give a woman a dish, and you feed her for a Day. Share a recipe with a woman, and she will use it for Lifetime! :o)</p>

<p>If you have any traditional South Indian recipes that you would like to share or want me to add to this web site, please let me know.
	Please feel free to explore my website and try out new recipes!</p>

<p>The following are some of the new recipes I added. Enjoy and don't forget to share your experience!</p>
