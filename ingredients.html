 The following are the common ingredients in three different languages. I thought it would be easier if I capture all the ingredients in one place, so that it is easy to look up :) The items are in no particular order, but having them all in one place is first step. We can always go back and organize stuff later!

<table>
<tr>
<th>English</th><th>Hindi</th><th>Telugu</th>
</tr>
{% for i in site.data.ingredients %}
<tr>
  <td>{{ i.english }}</td>
  <td>{{ i.hindi }}</td>
  <td>{{ i.telugu }}</td>
</tr>
{% endfor %}
</table>
