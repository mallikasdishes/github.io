	<h1>About</h1>

	<p>I'm Mallika, and welcome to my food blog! I am a vegetarian from Southern part of India, and I love to cook & try out new recipes. I will be posting the recipes from time to time on my blog here at [https://www.mallikasdishes.com](https://www.mallikasdishes.com) website. If you enjoy any of the recipes I post, feel free to leave a comment.</p>

	<p>I grew up in India, and learned to cook from my mother and friends. I am a full-time mom, and always trying out new things to keep my hungry kids happy. If you have any specific questions or want to request for a new recipe, please feel free to drop me a message.</p>
