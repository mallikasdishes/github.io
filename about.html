	<h1>About</h1>

	<p>I'm <strong>Mallika</strong>, and welcome to my website! I love to cook & try out new recipes. I will be sharing new recipes from time to time on my website here. If you enjoy any of the recipes I have here, feel free to leave a comment.</p>

	<p>I grew up in Andhra Pradesh, South India, and learned to cook from my mother, relatives and friends. I am a full-time mom, and always trying out new things to keep my hungry kids happy :o) Some of these recipes have been passed onto me from many generations, and if you are into authentic South Indian Vegetarian food, you've come to the right place.</p>
	
	<p><b>P.S</b>. Throughout this website, you will see some words that might not make sense to you if you are not from Andhra Pradesh. For example - Kandi Podi, Nuvvula Podi, Karivepaku Podi...etc. Those are the names of the dishes in Telugu language, and I will try my best to provide you some sort of English translation, so you know what it means. </p>
	
	<p>If you have any specific questions or want to request for a new recipe, please feel free to drop me a message. Happy Cooking!</p>
