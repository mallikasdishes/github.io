	<h1>About</h1>

	<p>I'm Mallika, and welcome to my website! I love to cook & try out new recipes. I will be sharing new recipes from time to time on my website here. If you enjoy any of the recipes I post, feel free to leave a comment.</p>

	<p>I grew up in South India, and learned to cook from my mother, relatives and friends. I am a full-time mom, and always trying out new things to keep my hungry kids happy :o). Some of these recipes have been passed onto me from many generations, and if you are into authentic South Indian Vegetarian food, you've come to the right place. </p>
		
	<p>If you have any specific questions or want to request for a new recipe, please feel free to drop me a message. Happy Cooking!</p>
